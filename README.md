I'm a software engineer who gets way too excited about distributed systems and infrastructure automation. I spend most of my time in Go and Kubernetes, building services that (hopefully) don't wake me up at night. Right now I'm deep in the cloud native ecosystem with AWS, Terraform, but I'm always learning. If it makes systems more reliable or developers more productive, I'm interested.
